## Summary

This was my second React project. I had a lot of fun building it out. Fetching data from an API was interesting to learn about. In this project solotifying state was great.

Consistency was the key to being able to get this project done in a timely manner. I'm really looking forward to moving on and really excited for what I'm going to work on next.
